# Contribution Guide

Thank you so much for contributing to the Science Component Library! We hope the library will help save you time on your project, and also serve as a way to scale your impact through leveraging your learnings and best practices to all other projects that use this library üí™üöÄ

## Steps to start üéØ

1. [Sign up](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) for an npm account! Since you‚Äôll need it to publish the package

1. Ask **@thuang** or anyone you know that is a collaborator of the npm package to add your account to the collab list

1. Download the repo to your local machine and fire it up with `yarn && yarn start`, it will automatically start a local Storybook instance, and you can browse existing components there as well

1. Take a quick tour of all existing components and see the different ways we use to style the MUI components. We will also cover the different styling strategies in details in the [styling section](#styling)

1. Once you‚Äôre ready to test your new shiny component in your product project (IDseq, Aspen, etc.), do the following steps:

   1. Make sure your new component is exported in `src/index.ts`

   1. `yarn build` to compile the components, generate their Typescript definitions, and export them as `index.cjs.js` and `index.esm.js` in `/dist` folder

   1. If you **ARE NOT** using Happy Path (which uses Docker virtual machine as local development environment), you can go to your product project and install your local component library directory like so: `npm install RELATIVE_PATH_TO_COMPONENT_LIBRARY`.

      E.g., `npm install ../sci-components` if your projects look like this: `parentFolder/productProject` and `parentFolder/sci-components`

   1. If you **ARE** using Happy Path, since our local component library directory is **NOT** mounted in the local Docker container, the app won‚Äôt be able to find the directory. So the only way to test out the component library is to publish it to `npm` and then upgrade your `czifui` dependency accordingly

      Steps:

      1. Publish a new version to npm

      1. In your project‚Äôs `frontend` folder, `npm remove czifui && npm i czifui@latest`, this will upgrade your `czifui` version to the latest, please double check `package.json` has the latest version

      1. In another terminal tab, at the root of your product project (e.g., /aspen`:

      1. Run `docker-compose exec frontend /bin/bash`, this will ssh into your local FE Docker container

      1. Run `npm i`- this is needed to ensure the container updates its node_modules/ properly, because often it doesn‚Äôt update

      1. Exit out of the ssh and run`make local-sync`, this will recompile your FE container and the app to start using the latest component library code

      1. At your product project‚Äôs `frontend`folder, run`npm i`again, this is needed because when FE container runs`npm i`, it overwrites `package-lock.json`with version 1 schema, since it doesn‚Äôt have npm 7.x, whereas your local machine is likely running v7 already. So we‚Äôll`npm i`again to overwrite the`package-lock.json` back to the new version 2 schema!

      1. Now you should be able to check `localhost:3000` and see the new component in action!

      1. Now you should be able to import your component via `import { ComponentName} from "czifui"` and verify that it works as intended in your feature!

1. When you‚Äôre happy with your component, please submit a [PR](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components/pulls) to get a code review

1. Once your PR is merged, please follow the steps below to publish a new package version üöÄ

   1. `npm version patch` to bump up a patch version. E.g., 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
   1. `npm publish` to upload the new package to npm registry!

1. Congrats and thank you for contributing to the component library üôåüëèüéâ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è!!

## Styling

When it comes to styling Material UI's components, generally the following strategies should cover the most use cases. However, if none of the strategies work for you, please reach out to CZI Slack channels **#org-tech-frontend** and **#help-frontend** for help!

1. Straight up `styled()` wrapping the component to style the root element

   When to use: Look for the MUI component's CSS API section, if `root` is available, wrapping the component in `styled()` will apply the styles to the root element

   For example, MUI `<Button />` component has `root` CSS API as shown [here](https://material-ui.com/api/button/#css). As a result, the following code will work:

   ```ts
   const StyledButton = styled(Button)`
     // This will change the text color to pink
     color: pink;
   `
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `czifui` `<Button />` implementation [here](../src/core/Button/index.tsx)

1. Wrap the component with `styled()` and target `.Mui*` global class names

   When to use: When you need to style a **descendant** of the root element.

   NOTE: If the element is **NOT** a descendant of the root element, such as when the element is rendered in a React Portal, **outside** of the root element's tree, use the `classes` strategy below

   For example, MUI `<Chip />` element renders a descendant element `label` as shown in the screenshot below. As a result, the easiest way to style the `label` element is below:

   ```ts
   const StyledChip = styled(Chip)`
     .MuiChip-label {
       padding: 0;
     }
   `
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `czifui` `<Chip />` implementation [here](../src/core/Chip/index.tsx)

   You can also find all the CSS API for the MUI component under the CSS section of its API page.

   E.g., [Chip CSS API section](https://material-ui.com/api/chip/#css)

1. Use Material UI's `classes` prop to pass css class names to targeted element

   When to use: When the element is **NOT** a descendant of the root element, such as when the element is rendered in a React Portal, **outside** of the root element's tree

   For example, MUI `<Tooltip />` component has an arrow element that's rendered **outside** of the root element's tree as shown in the screenshot below. As a result, the only way to style the `arrow` element is through passing a class name for styling the `arrow` element to `<Tooltip classes={{ arrow: 'class-name-here' }} />`.

   Like so:

   ```tsx
    import { css } from "@emotion/css";

    // css() registers the style and returns a css class name
    const arrowCss = css`
      color: pink;
    `

    <Tooltip classes={{arrow: arrowCss}} />
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `czifui` `<Tooltip />` implementation [here](../src/core/Tooltip/index.tsx)

   You can also find all the CSS API for the MUI component under the CSS section of its API page.

   E.g., [Tooltip CSS API section](https://material-ui.com/api/tooltip/#css)
