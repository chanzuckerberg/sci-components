        This story currently excludes Tags with both `sdsType` of `primary` and
        `color` of `gray`, and those with `color` of `success` and `primary`,
        because they do not pass the a11y tests. They have their own stories
        wherein the a11y tests are disabled until the a11y tests are updated to
        accommodate APCA (for gray x primary) or until the Tag colors are
        updated by design (for success and primary).
