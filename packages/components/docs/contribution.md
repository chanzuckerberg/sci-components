1. [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) (we are using v4, but definitely keeping an eye on v5 as they take shape!)

## Steps to start üéØ

1. Download the repo to your local machine and fire it up with `yarn && yarn start`, it will automatically start a local Storybook instance, and you can browse existing components there as well

1. Take a quick tour of all existing components and see the different ways we use to style the MUI components. We will also cover the different styling strategies in details in the [styling section](#styling)

1. Once you‚Äôre ready to test your new shiny component in your product project (IDseq, Aspen, etc.), do the following steps:

   1. Make sure your new component is exported in `src/index.ts`

   1. `yarn build` to compile the components, generate their Typescript definitions, and export them as `index.cjs.js` and `index.esm.js` in `/dist` folder

   1. If you **ARE NOT** using Happy Path (which uses Docker virtual machine as local development environment), you can go to your product project and install your local component library directory like so: `npm install RELATIVE_PATH_TO_COMPONENT_LIBRARY`.

      E.g., `npm install ../sci-components` if your projects look like this: `parentFolder/productProject` and `parentFolder/sci-components`

   1. If you **ARE** using Happy Path, since our local component library directory is **NOT** mounted in the local Docker container, the app won‚Äôt be able to find the directory. So the only way to test out the component library is to publish it to `npm` and then upgrade your `@czi-sds/components` dependency accordingly.

1. When you‚Äôre happy with your component, please submit a [PR](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components/pulls) to get a code review

1. Once your PR is merged, congrats and thank you for contributing to the component library üôåüëèüéâ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è!!

## Styling

When it comes to styling Material UI's components, generally the following strategies should cover the most use cases. However, if none of the strategies work for you, please reach out to CZI Slack channels **#org-tech-frontend** and **#help-frontend** for help!

1. Straight up `styled()` wrapping the component to style the root element

   When to use: Look for the MUI component's CSS API section, if `root` is available, wrapping the component in `styled()` will apply the styles to the root element

   For example, MUI `<Button />` component has `root` CSS API as shown [here](https://material-ui.com/api/button/#css). As a result, the following code will work:

   ```ts
   const StyledButton = styled(Button)`
     // This will change the text color to pink
     color: pink;
   `;
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `@czi-sds/components` `<Button />` implementation [here](../src/core/Button/index.tsx)

1. Wrap the component with `styled()` and target `.Mui*` global class names

   When to use: When you need to style a **descendant** of the root element.

   NOTE: If the element is **NOT** a descendant of the root element, such as when the element is rendered in a React Portal, **outside** of the root element's tree, use the `classes` strategy below

   For example, MUI `<Chip />` element renders a descendant element `label` as shown in the screenshot below. As a result, the easiest way to style the `label` element is below:

   ```ts
   const StyledChip = styled(Chip)`
     .MuiChip-label {
       padding: 0;
     }
   `;
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `@czi-sds/components` `<Chip />` implementation [here](../src/core/Chip/index.tsx)

   You can also find all the CSS API for the MUI component under the CSS section of its API page.

   E.g., [Chip CSS API section](https://material-ui.com/api/chip/#css)

1. Use Material UI's `classes` prop to pass css class names to targeted element

   When to use: When the element is **NOT** a descendant of the root element, such as when the element is rendered in a React Portal, **outside** of the root element's tree

   For example, MUI `<Tooltip />` component has an arrow element that's rendered **outside** of the root element's tree as shown in the screenshot below. As a result, the only way to style the `arrow` element is through passing a class name for styling the `arrow` element to `<Tooltip classes={{ arrow: 'class-name-here' }} />`.

   Like so:

   ```tsx
    import { css } from "@emotion/css";

    // css() registers the style and returns a css class name
    const arrowCss = css`
      color: pink;
    `

    <Tooltip classes={{arrow: arrowCss}} />
   ```

   üí° You can find the full `@czi-sds/components` `<Tooltip />` implementation [here](../src/core/Tooltip/index.tsx)

   You can also find all the CSS API for the MUI component under the CSS section of its API page.

   E.g., [Tooltip CSS API section](https://material-ui.com/api/tooltip/#css)

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6309723/124044319-07a3f300-d9c2-11eb-847e-45d522808b95.png)

1. If you are modifying or adding a new Base (colors, borders, typogrpahy, etc), be sure to add them to the [style-dictionary.json](../src/common/styles-dictionary/style-dictionary.json) in addition to updating the [defaultheme.ts](../src/core/styles/common/defaultTheme.ts). Run `sd-build` before committing your changes. `@czi-sds/components` uses [style-dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to generate css and scss variable stylesheets. This allows projects that use css modules or scss to still benefit from our standard styles. The `style-dictionary.json` is the source of truth for these css & scss stylesheets.

New additions to the `style-dictionary.json` should be nested accordingly:

```json
{
  "sds": { // this prefixes all variables from our package to increase specificity
    "category": { // this is what the new variable is at a high level (font, color, space)
      "type": { // this is the main grouping within the category (body, success, size)
```

All tokens must have a `value` and can optionally have a `comment`, which can give insight into how the value should be used.

To generate a stylesheet in a new language, update the [config.json](../src/common/styles-dictionary/config.json) to include the new transformGroup(language) in the `platforms` object. See a list of possible languages [here](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/blob/main/lib/common/formats.js), though custom ones can be built.

```json
{
  "source": ["src/common/styles-dictionary/*.json"],
  "platforms": {
    "new-language": {
      "transformGroup": "language-format",
      "buildPath": "src/common/styles-dictionary/new-language/",
      "files": [
        {
          "destination": "variables.language-format",
          "format": "language-format/variables"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the config has been updated, run `sd-build` to generate the new stylesheet. Import it at the top of [index.ts](../src/index.ts). Update and install any plugins needed by rollup to support the new file type. Set the output for new files to be `variables.language-format` where `language-format` is the file type. This will allow rollup to bundle the new stylesheet and make it available for import.

## Testing

This repo uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as it's main testing framework and [@storybook/react](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/react) as middleware to reuse stories as tests. Tests are written for each component to test for functionality and integration. Currently, as components are small and independent, unit tests are the bulk of the test written. As more complex components are created, integration tests will become the bulk of the test coverage. Snapshots are captured to test for changes to the DOM.

Snapshots should only be captured of the Test story. Use the following to skip snapshots on Default and LivePreview:

```tsx
// index.stories.tsx
Default.parameters = {
  snapshot: {
    skip: true,
  },
};

LivePreview.parameters = {
  snapshot: {
    skip: true,
  },
};
```

If snapshots needs to be updated (due to anticipated DOM changes), run `yarn test path/to/test/file -u `

This repo will also be using Chromatic to run visual testing. Chromatic captures visual changes between components and also hosts live versions of components so designers and engineers can quickly and easily interact with them witout needin to spin up a local Storybook instance. More info on how to capture visual stories in Chromatic will be added in November.

## Commit Message

This repo uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to ensure the
commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
so we can do semantic versioning properly

NOTE: If your PR has more than one commit, please kindly make sure the first line of your commit reflects the most important commit type, so Semantic Release will trigger the right release version. More details [here](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request#action-semantic-pull-request)

NOTE: Commitizen command is automatically triggered through [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) when you write a commit message. However, you can always do `^ + C` to skip Commitizen if you're not ready to submit a PR!

## Major/Breaking Change Release

Major/Breaking Change Release should happen on `next` branch first, so we publish the breaking change version bump on `packageName@next` first. After the `next` branch is merged into `main`, the new breaking change version will be available on `packageName@latest`

WARNING: Please "rebase and merge" `next` into `main` via a merge commit instead of "squash and merge", otherwise Semantic Release won't be able to analyze the commit messages correctly [source](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/troubleshooting#squashed-commits-are-ignored-by-semantic-release)

If Github detects merge conflicts when merging `next` into `main`, please create a new branch from `main`, merge `next` into the new branch, resolve conflicts, then create a PR against `main`.

Example:

1. `git fetch && git stash && git checkout main && git checkout -b temp-main && git merge origin next`
1. Resolve conflicts, then make commit
1. `git push -u origin temp-main`
1. Create a PR
