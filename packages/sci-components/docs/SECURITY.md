# Reporting Security Issues

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation (CZIF) team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:security@chanzuckerberg.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The CZIF team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
