# Colors

Color helps communicate usage and intent while providing brand distinction. Our palette has been selected for meaning, accessibility, and cohesion.

## Primary Colors

These are the most frequently used colors in the UI's design. Primary400 is the main brand color and is the default color choice for most interactive elements across the product. Black is featured prominently through headlines and body text with the other shades of Gray and Primary Blue used to help distinguish and differentiate elements throughout the UI.

### Primary Blue
