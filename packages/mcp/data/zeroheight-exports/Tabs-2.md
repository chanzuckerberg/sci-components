# Tabs

Tabs allow users to switch between different sets of information or content that is related to one overarching category or group while staying on the same page.

## Overview

## Tab Variants

| There are two sizes of Tabs available for use determined by their location in the UI. Each size can include a counter to indicate the number of items on that tab’s screen such as search or filter results. They can also be paired with an underline that spans the width of the entire div the tab group is placed within to provide visual separation between the Tabs and the content beneath them.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Tab size for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Large](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/32ab1e-tabs/t/395377) [Small](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/32ab1e-tabs/t/0203de) |
