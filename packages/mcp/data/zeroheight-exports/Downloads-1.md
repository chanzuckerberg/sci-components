# Downloads

There are instances where users may want to download data that are uploaded to CZ ID. There are three download types that commonly occur, see recommended flows and best practices below.

## Data Download Types

| Many Science products help users manipulate, visualize, and interpret data they’ve uploaded. Sometimes users want to download data that have been uploaded in order to, for example, perform more complex analyses using the tools they know best. Three types of downloading data are common across our products: immediately downloading individual files, immediately downloading multiple files, and asynchronously downloading multiple files. |   | **Jump to type:** [Individual, Immediate](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/63a08d-downloads/t/088763) [Multiple, Immediate](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/63a08d-downloads/t/59681b) [Multiple, Asynchronous](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/63a08d-downloads/t/20bbc5) |

## Individual File, Immediate Download

Individual files can typically be downloaded immediately. If the user can configure their download (e.g., file type), a dialog may appear. The download will begin within the user’s browser as soon as they confirm their selection.

The example flow below shows the immediate download of an individual data file.

## Multiple Files, Immediate Download

If the files are small enough, users can download multiple files at once by selecting multiple files, then clicking a button to initiate the download. If the user can configure their download (e.g., file type), a dialog may appear. The download will begin within the user’s browser as soon as they confirm their selection.

The example flow below shows the immediate download of multiple data files.

## Multiple Files, Asynchronous Download

If the files are too large to download immediately, users can initiate an asynchronous download flow for multiple files. Users can select multiple files at once, then click a button to initiate the download. If the user can configure their download (e.g., file type), a dialog may appear.

Once the user confirms their selection, the system will begin generating their download in the background and show a confirmation message. Users can download the generated file once it’s completed from a dedicated Downloads page.

The example flow below shows the asynchronous download of multiple data files.
