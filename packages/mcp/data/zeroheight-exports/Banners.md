# Banners

Banners are used to communicate product status updates to users, allowing the product teams to provide important information to their users.

## Overview

## Banner Variants

| Banners are meant to communicate product status updates to users such as system maintenance, new features, known product bugs or issues. etc. and are not meant to be used in response to an action the user has taken within the product. Use a Callout or Notification for these purposes.  There are two Banner variants meant to be used in an alternating manner, allowing multiple Banners to be stacked together while maintaining the ability to differentiate between them.  Both Banner variants can optionally be set to be manually dismissible by the user, allowing them to hide the Banner from view once it has been read.  Banners span the full width of the page.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Banner for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** Primary Secondary |

### Primary Banner

Use this variant in instances where only one Banner will be used on the page. If using multiple, this should be the first or top Banner used, followed by the secondary variant. Continue alternating variants for as many Banners as are needed. This ensures the Banners can be differentiated without the need for space or divider lines between them.

If additional context or information is needed beyond the space available on the Banner, it is recommended that a Link to an additional page with this information is included.

When the information being communicated on the Banner is intended to remain persistent on the screen and is not manually dismissible by the user, use a persistent Banner. To allow the user to manually dismiss the Banner, use a dismissible Banner.

### Secondary Banner

Use only when accompanied by the primary variant. If using multiple, this should be the second Banner used, followed by the primary variant. Continue alternating variants for as many Banners as are needed. This ensures the Banners can be differentiated without the need for space or divider lines between them.

If additional context or information is needed beyond the space available on the Banner, it is recommended that a Link to an additional page with this information is included.
