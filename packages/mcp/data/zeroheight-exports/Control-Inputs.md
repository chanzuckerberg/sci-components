# Control Inputs

Control Inputs are elements that enable users to make selections and communicate choices when presented with various options in the UI.

## Overview

## Control Input Variants

| There are two Control Input components available for designers to use depending on the type of action or response they are needing to elicit from the user. Checkbox and Radio Inputs must always be accompanied by a label that communicates the result of the selection.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Control Input for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Checkbox](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/818f0c-control-inputs/t/373b8f) [Radio](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/818f0c-control-inputs/t/0807b0) |

## Checkbox Input

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use when the user can select multiple options from a group of choices. Each Checkbox must be coupled with a label to communicate the result of a selection.

Use `sdsStage: indeterminate` to indicate a mixed selection; reserved for cases where "Select All" is an option as part of a group of checkboxes.

## Control Input Components

| Below you will find interactive Storybook iframes for each component within the Control Input element group.  Tabs within each iframe provide a different set of tools: The Controls tab allows you to see and adjust all available props. The Actions tab shows you data displayed by event handler arguments. |   | **Jump to component:** [InputCheckbox](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/818f0c-control-inputs/t/207e4f) [InputRadio](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/818f0c-control-inputs/t/75acb8) |

>These components appear as they are in the default SDS codebase. Once imported into the napari hub or napari.org codebases, use a theme file to enable the napari visual appearance customization.
