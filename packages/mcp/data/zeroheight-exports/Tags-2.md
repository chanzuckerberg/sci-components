# Tags

Tags are used to label the status of certain elements or in conjunction with filters to indicate which have been applied when viewing datasets.

## Overview

## Tag Variants

| There are two primary Tag variants—Filter Tags and standard Tags. Filter Tags are used in conjunction with the [Filter](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/332c08) component to indicate which filters have been applied to a given dataset. Standard Tags come in two styles, Rounded and Square, and can be used throughout the UI whenever there's a need to label an element or communicate a status associated with it.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Tag for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Filter](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/8717f1-tags/t/22e0eb) [Rounded](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/8717f1-tags/t/57c31f) [Square](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/8717f1-tags/t/51d96b) |

## Tag Components

| Below you will find interactive Storybook iframes for each component within the Tags element group.  Tabs within each iframe provide a different set of tools: The Controls tab allows you to see and adjust all available props. The Actions tab shows you data displayed by event handler arguments. |   | **Jump to component:** [TagFilter](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/8717f1-tags/t/23688c) [Tag](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/8717f1-tags/t/12c6bb) |
