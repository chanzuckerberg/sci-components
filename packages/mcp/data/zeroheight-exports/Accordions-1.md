# Accordions

To help control the amount of information presented to the user, Accordions are expandable/collapsable elements that hide and reveal content.

## Overview

Accordions are elements that can be used by designers to hide or reveal content. Use the header text to communicate what type of content the user can expect to see when the Accordion is expanded. They can optionally include a bottom-positioned divider line to help visually separate an Accordion from the one below it.

Once expanded, the content revealed within the Accordion can be whatever the designer desires, whether basic text or another component or element.
