# Text Link

Text Links are interactive elements that, when clicked, navigate the user away from the page they are currently viewing to another page or screen.

## Overview

|  | In Figma |   |  | Meets Accessibility |   |  | In napari hub + .org Codebases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use Text Links to navigate the user away from the page they are currently viewing to another page or screen. They can be used inline or separate from a paragraph of text. There are four Text Link sizes available—`bodyM`, `bodyS`, `bodyXs`, `bodyXxs`—each corresponding to the four sizes of body copy available in the napari hub and napari.org codebases.

Note: Designers, when including an inline Text Link in your design, styles must be manually applied as there is no way to save the Text Link style in Figma as a text style. You may use the Text Link Figma component for links that are not inline.

Click on each state below to enter inspect view and get details on its code attributes and any global styles it uses.
