# Dropdown Input

The Dropdown Input is an element that triggers Dropdown Menus to open, enabling users to make selections and communicate choices in the UI.

## Overview

Dropdown Inputs are always accompanied by a [Dropdown Menu](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/95546f) which is triggered by the user clicking on the input.

The Dropdown Input is used on napari hub as part of plugin [Filters](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/740252), enabling users to find plugins relevant to their work more easily.
