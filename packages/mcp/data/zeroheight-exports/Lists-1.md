# Lists

Utilizing a list to present information makes it easier to digest or act upon when compared to showing that same content in a solid block of text.

## Overview

## List Variants

| There are two types of Lists—Unordered Lists where the order of content does not matter and Ordered Lists which communicate a specific sequence for the content. Use a Header with either list type to help provide context to the content presented in the list.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct List for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Unordered](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/770a21-lists/t/372688) [Ordered](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/770a21-lists/t/388f21) |
