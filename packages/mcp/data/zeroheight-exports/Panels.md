# Panels

Panels are elements that contain supplementary information or actions for the page's content they appear on. Where and how they display is determined by the type of content on them.

Panels are comprised of containers within which other elements are placed. Use the Basic Panel when the elements contained within it are able to functionally adjust the content on the page next to it. In CZ GEN EPI's case, the Basic Panel is positioned on the left-hand side of the screen and contains [Filters](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/26758d-filters). 

### Basic Panel Example

The example below shows where in CZ GEN EPI the Basic Panel is used.
