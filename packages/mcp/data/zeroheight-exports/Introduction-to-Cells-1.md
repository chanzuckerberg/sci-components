# Introduction to Cells

Cells are guidelines for flows and functionality that often span multiple pages or screens, combining Bases, Genes, and DNA. 

|  |   | **Cells** *Flows*  Cells are created when multiple Bases, Genes, and DNA are combined to create multi-step and occasionally multi-page flows. They serve as guidelines for designers and engineers to follow and are not self-contained components in and of themselves. Instead, they provide best practices for designers and engineers to consider when implementing similar functionality in their products. |   |
