# Tabs

Tabs allow users to switch between different sets of information or content that is related to one overarching category or group while staying on the same page.

## Overview

## Tab Variants

| There are two sizes of Tabs available for use determined by their location in the UI. Each size can include a counter to indicate the number of items on that tab’s screen such as search or filter results. They can also be paired with an underline that spans the width of the entire div the tab group is placed within to provide visual separation between the Tabs and the content beneath them.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Tab size for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Large](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/42b258-tabs/t/7559bb) [Small](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/42b258-tabs/t/091125) |

### Large Tabs

Default Tabs size to be used throughout the CZ GEN EPI UI.

In CZ GEN EPI, Large Tabs holding quantifiable data sets (like a sample table) should include a Count to allow users to be aware of data that isn't currently visible. On the group page for members and group details, Large Tabs without a count are used to separate between sections.

Overall, include a counter when necessary to indicate the number of items on that Tab's screen, whether visible or not visible, such as when displaying search or filter results.

| **Default** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Default + Count** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Default + Underline** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

 

| **Default + Count + Underline** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Small Tabs

Alternative Tab size to be used only in conjunction with Large Tabs when a secondary layer of tabbing is needed.

Include a counter when necessary to indicate the number of items on that Tab's screen, such as in the Members section of CZ GEN EPI, to help delineate between active members and outstanding invitations to the group.

| **Default** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Default + Count** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Default + Underline** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Default + Count + Underline** | **Hover** | **Active** | **Disabled** |

These rules establish how much margin should exist between and around elements.
