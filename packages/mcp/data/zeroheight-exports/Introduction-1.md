# Introduction

Welcome to the CZ GEN EPI Design System! As we grow we want to make sure we are creating a consistent experience for our users and that both designers and engineers are reusing components to ensure consistency and not duplicate efforts.

This Design System should be consistent with the code base and needs to stay up-to-date, we will communicate and help each other do so! As we design and build features, we will prioritize what’s in the Design System, unless there is a good reason to create a new component.

### Design System Elements

Our design system is made up of a structure of elements:

|  |   | **Bases** *Foundational Elements* Bases are the very basic elements that all components are created from. |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |   |   |
|  |   | **Genes** *Simple Elements* Genes are simple components that can be made of multiple bases. |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|  |   | **DNA** *Complex Elements* DNA are complex components that are made from a combination of Bases and Genes. |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|  |   | **Chromosomes** *Pages* Chromosomes are pages like our project page that include filters, search, and the table. |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|  |   | **Cells** *Flows* Cells are multi-page flows with different functions. For example, the download flow spans the project page, download selection, and download page. |   |

### Goals

Utilizing a design system helps us accomplish the following goals:

|  **Component** **Consistency** |   |  **Cohesive Design and Code Language** |   |  **Expedite the Design and Engineering Process** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clearly defined and documented components ensure a consistent experience for users. Our components are designed and built in a reusable and scalable way. |   | We want to make sure what is in design files and the codebase are the same with shared naming. We want to make sure it’s in sync, to help our collaboration during development. |   | With these definitions, it will be easier for design and implementation to have clarity on which components to use. We’re eliminating guesswork to speed up the process. |
