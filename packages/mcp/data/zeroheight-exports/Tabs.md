# Tabs

Tabs allow users to switch between different sets of information or content that is related to one overarching category or group while staying on the same page.

## Overview

## Tab Variants

| There are two sizes of Tabs available for use determined by their location in the UI. Individual tabs within each size can optionally include an alert to draw user's attention to something specific on that tab, such as to communicate the content on the tab is newly added or updated. They can also be paired with an underline that spans the width of the entire div the tab group is placed within to provide visual separation between the Tabs and the content beneath them.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Tab size for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Large](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/084160-tabs/t/131a83) [Small](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/084160-tabs/t/59e830) |

### Large Tabs

Default Tabs size to be used throughout the UI. Specifically used in napari hub at the top of plugin detail pages allowing users to change between the plugin's description and additional information such as usage activity and related analytics or citation information.

An optional alert can be added on a per Tab basis to communicate additional details about the Tab or the content on it, for example, indicating that the Tab is new or has been recently updated.

Tabs can also optionally be paired with an underline beneath them that spans the width of the entire div the Tab group is placed within.
