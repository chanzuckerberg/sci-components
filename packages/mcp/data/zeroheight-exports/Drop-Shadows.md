# Drop Shadows

Drop shadows provide depth to designs via elevation to help users distinguish between overlapping layers of content.

### Types of Drop Shadows

| **Visual** |   | **Shadow Type** |   | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |   | Large Shadow |   | Containers that layer on top of all other page content (bottom â€¨panels, side panels, modals, etc.) |
|  |   | Medium Shadow |   | Containers that are part of a page's content, but appear on user input, layering over primary content (dropdown menus, tooltips, etc.) |
|  |   | Small Shadow |   | Containers that layer closely over content, including images of documents/screens placed in content, and sign up forms |
