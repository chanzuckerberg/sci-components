# Segmented Control

Segmented Control allows users to toggle between different views within an on-screen element such as viewing the same set of data in table or tree format.

## Overview

 Segmented Control allows users to toggle between different views of an on-screen element. There must be a minimum of two and can be up to four segments.

The Segmented Control component is comprised of Segmented Control Items each of which has a Default, Hover, and Active state. Designers can swap out default icons for icons relevant to their needed use case.

### Segmented Control Spacing

These rules establish how much margin should exist between and around elements.

### Segmented Control Best Practices

Segmented control relies on icons to communicate what’s being shown to the user. Because of this, it should always be coupled with a dark [Tooltip](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/263764) that displays the name of the segment item when the user hovers over it.
