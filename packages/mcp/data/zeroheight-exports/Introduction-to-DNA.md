# Introduction to DNA

DNA are complex components that are made from a combination of Bases and Genes.

They are functionally more complex and are used throughout the UI as self-contained elements that aid users in completing tasks, viewing and interacting with data and information, making selections, and communicating decisions in the product. |   |
