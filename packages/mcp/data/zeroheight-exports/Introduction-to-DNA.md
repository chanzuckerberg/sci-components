# Introduction to DNA

DNA are complex components that are made from a combination of Bases and Genes.

|  |   | **DNA** *Complex Elements*  DNA are created when multiple Bases and Genes are combined together. They are functionally more complex and are used throughout the UI as self-contained elements that aid users in completing tasks, viewing and interacting with data and information, making selections, and communicating decisions in the product. |   |
