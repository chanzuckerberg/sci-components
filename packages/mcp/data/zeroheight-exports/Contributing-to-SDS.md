# Contributing to SDS

Use the following guides when you have a new request for something to be added or changed in the design system or want to serve as a contributor to the SDS team

## Contribution Guide

### Contribution and Request Flow

#### Assess and Plan

1. Check if the component already exists by checking the [SDS Documentation](https://sds.czi.design/) to confirm
2. If not, submit the request or idea you want to contribute to the SDS by creating a [github issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components/issues/new/choose)
3. The SDS Team will assess the request and make sure they understand the needs
4. **Decision Point**: should it be included in the SDS?
    1. If the needs are joint across multiple projects, the SDS team will likely decide to include it
    2. If not, it can become a **Snowflake** (a one-off component maintained by the product teams)

#### Design

1. **Decision Point**: who will build the component, the SDS or product team?
    1. SDS team – if the SDS team has bandwidth in alignment with other priorities
    2. Product team – if the product team is in a rush and need it sooner. They may build for SDS or in their own codebase to be incorporated into SDS later
2. Design Process – gather requirements, design critique, design review with SDS team and product teams, and iteration and hand-off to engineering with specs. Communicate with teams throughout.

#### Implementation and Testing

1. Engineering Design Review – for larger components and when needed, review engineering design plans
2. Code Implementation with PRs, Design QA
3. Documentation Build
4. Figma Component Build

**Launch**

1. Communicate Update – release notes in** #sci-design-system-releases** channel

### Contribution Guides

When getting started with contributing, here are guides to follow. Be sure to also partner with an SDS core team member.

* Contributing Design – [SDS Feature Design Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7Nuf77Muv6vJVevUkL057FmYR5PrZgvxBCLASSdsrE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Contributing Code – [guide coming soon]
* Contributing Documentation – [guide coming soon]

## Contributor Models

### Ways to Contribute

There are a range of tasks and projects to work on as a contributor to the SDS, such as:

* Fixing a bug; grab something from the backlog
* Flagging things to the SDS team; give the SDS team feedback
* Brainstorming new feature needs; suggest features
* Participating in engineering design reviews

### Commitment Levels

Contributing to the SDS doesn't need to be a huge time commitment and there are many different ways to serve as a contributor to the SDS.

#### One-Off Contributor (Occasional)

* Contribute when they have free time or interest in a particular project
* No commitment to contribute long term; contributions can be sporadic

Some examples include: 

* Participating during SDS events, such as hackathons, sprints, or workshops
* Pick up one-off tickets, such as a well-defined accessibility task
* Make fixes or contributions on things relevant to your current work—if you’re already working on something on your team and want to contribute back to SDS

#### Team Representative

These contributors are go-to SDS advocates on their teams and point people. Their expectations include:

* Consistent involvement within their team
* Act as advocates, spreading awareness and encouraging participation, such as:
    * Flagging when a SDS component is beneficial
    * When their team has a need to share with SDS
    * Watching for breaking changes so their team can react if needed
* May not be directly involved in development but promote the project's importance
* Project based: if the SDS team is collaborating on a project with their team

Current team representatives:

* Janeece Pourroy – design
* Harley Thomas – design
* Karen Liang – design
* Timmy Huang – engineering
* Jerry Fu – engineering

#### Commitment to a Timeframe (fixed-term)

These contributors commit to a specific period, typically 3 to 6 months, at the Quarter and Half planning times, to work on SDS and its roadmap. This involves:

* Defined time commitment
* Attend SDS meetings
* Typically involved in development, planning, or execution of project goals
* Providing a more predictable level of support over a specified timeframe
* Revisited after initial timeframe commitment is complete
