# Corners

Corners (border radiuses) provide visual, and often functional, distinction and help differentiate between different types of similar elements.

### Types of Corners

| **Example** |   | **Corner Type** |   | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |   | Large Corner |   | Rounded elements (buttons and inputs) |
|  |   | Medium Corner |   | Standard, default radius for corners in UI elements (square buttons, form inputs, modals, tooltips, tags, etc.) |
|  |   | Small Corner |   | Corners on elements that are smaller than 20px × 20px. |
|  |   | No Set Corner |   | Corners on backgrounds for hovered dropdown menus and tables. |

### Corner Variables
