# Corners

Corners (border radiuses) provide visual, and often functional, distinction and help differentiate between different types of similar elements.

### Types of Corners

| **Example** |   | **Corner Type** |   | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |   | Large Corner |   | Rounded elements (for example: rounded [Buttons](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/47778c) and rounded [Dropdown Inputs](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/1004b1)) |
|  |   | Medium Corner |   | Standard, default radius for corners in UI elements ( for example: square [Buttons](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/47778c), [Dialogs](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/707b97), square [Tags](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/39dc34), etc.) |
|  |   | Small Corner |   | Corners on elements that are smaller than 20px Ã— 20px that need a square corner (for example: [Checkboxes](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/548a3d-control-inputs/t/page-548a3d-79060787-161363-5)) |
|  |   | No Set Corner |   | Corners for elements without any radius (for example: backgrounds on [Menu Items](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/42bdf2-dropdown-menu/t/page-42bdf2-72655966-63b100-47) and [Table Cells](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/p/1647a1)) |

### Corner Variables
