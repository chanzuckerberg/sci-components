# Introduction to Bases

Bases are the very basic elements that all components are created from.

|     |     | **Bases** _Foundational Elements_ These basic building blocks are designed in a scalable way using coded variables which establishes a universal language between design and engineering that transcends pixel counts and hex codes, while also making components easily adjustable for use by other brands or products. For example, if another brand uses a different primary color in their palette, they need only to update that color variable in one location in their codebase, and the change will cascade throughout their entire project. |     |
