# Buttons

Buttons are one of the primary ways users interact with and provide input to the product's UI, serving as the main elements to solicit user action.

## Overview

## Button Variants

| There are a range of Button variants available for designers to use in their layouts depending on the amount of emphasis the Button needs to have, its location in the UI, and whether it is existing alone or alongside other Buttons.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Button for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Square](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/19fa79-buttons/t/893b1f) [Copy](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/19fa79-buttons/t/616e70) [Icon](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/19fa79-buttons/t/523de0) |
