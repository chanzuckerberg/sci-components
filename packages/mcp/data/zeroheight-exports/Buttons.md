### Button – Minimal

Minimal Buttons initiate actions that keep the user on the same page, such as opening or closing Dialogs. They should contain a maximum of 2-3 words.

If a longer or inline call to action with a similar visual style is needed, a Link might be more appropriate. In addition to containing more words, Text Links navigate the user away from their current page to a new one, whereas Minimal Buttons keep users on the same page.

#### Primary

Use for primary or emphasized actions.

### Button – Icon

Use when a standard Button doesn't seem necessary or won't fit such as when used as part of complex components like Tables. Button – Icon should generally be coupled with a Tooltip that is displayed on hover to provide a label indicating the Button's functionality.

Optionally, pair Button – Icon with a Tooltip to use as a label to communicate the button's functionality.

### Overview

Use Toggle Button when there is a need to enable or disable an element in the UI (such as toggling visibility of a Panel). If users need to indicate true or false as part of a form or flip a setting or option from off to on (and vise versa), use Toggle Input.

Optionally, pair Toggle Button with a Tooltip to use as a label to communicate the button's functionality.

### SDS Source Code

The component's source code in the SDS codebase can be found here.

### SDS vs MUI

The following props are available to MUI's `Button` component, but produce no effect (or unexpected effects) for SDS's `Button` component, so **it is recommended to not use them**:

* **`variant`****:**  This prop is intended to set the `Button` to either `text` only, `contained`,  or `outlined`.  With SDS's `Button`, they do not function as described in the MUI documentation; however, similar effects, specific to SDS's styles, can be achieved through a combination of the SDS-only props: `sdsStyle` and `sdsType` (see details below).
* **`color`****:**  SDS'S`Button`does not support this colors or intents that would be expected through this prop. However, the `sdsType` prop can be used to set the button color as `primary` or `secondary`.
* **`size`****:**  This prop is not supported for SDS's `Button`
* **`disableElevation`****:**  The SDS `Button` component doesn't have a visual "elevation" or shadowed treatment by default (which this prop disables for MUI's `Button`).  Setting `disableElevation={false}` will not render the MUI default elevation treatment.

Icons can be used in both MUI and SDS `Button` component, but are called in slightly different ways:

* **`startIcon`** and **`endIcon`****:**  Both of these props are supported by both MUI and SDS's `Buttons`.  However, MUI expects the prop to receive an individual icon as its own component (for example`startIcon={<DeleteIcon />}`), whereas SDS takes the `Icon` component which references which specific icon to call, as one of its props, as such:

		`startIcon={<Icon sdsIcon="download" sdsSize="s" sdsType="button" />}`  

SDS's `Button` has additional props to allow flexibility while maintaining the SDS styles:

* **`sdsStyle`****:**  takes `minimal` (default), `rounded`,  or `square` or `icon` as values
* **`sdsType`****:**  takes `primary` (default, filled) or `secondary` (outlined) as values

### MUI Documentation

Documentation for the underlying MUI `Button` component can be found here.

### Props

Any custom SDS props and MUI props required for implementation are found on the tables below. See the MUI documentation for additional optional props.

If `sdsStyle` is set to either `rounded` or `squared`, the props are as follows:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isAllCaps` | `bool` | `false` | When set to `true`, the button text will be displayed in all capital letters. Please note that the `isAllCaps` attribute only applies to buttons with the `sdsStyle` set to `minimal`. |
| `sdsStyle` | `"rounded" | "square"` | `-` | Style of the button. |
| `sdsType` | `"primary"`  `| "secondary"`  `| "destructive"` | `-` | Type of the button. |

If `sdsStyle` is set to `minimal`, the props are listed below:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isAllCaps` | `bool` | `false` | When set to `true`, the button text will be displayed in all capital letters. Please note that the `isAllCaps` attribute only applies to buttons with the `sdsStyle` set to `minimal`. |
| `sdsStyle` | `"minimal"` | `-` | Style of the button. |
| `sdsType` | `"primary"` `| "secondary"` | `-` | Type of the button. |

And if the `sdsStyle` is set to `icon`, the props are listed below:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdsSize` | `"small"`  `| "medium"`  `| "large"` | `medium` | Determines the size of the button icon. |
| `sdsStyle` | `"icon"` | `-` | Style of the button. |
| `sdsType` | `"primary"` `| "secondary"`  `| "tertiary"` | `-` | Type of the button icon. |
| `icon` | `SDSIcon | React.ReactElement<CustomSVGProps>` | `-` | The actual icon |
| `sdsIconProps` | `Partial<IconProps>` | `-` | Props for the icon if an sds icon is used. |

## ButtonDropdown

### SDS Source Code

The component's source code in the SDS codebase can be found here.

### SDS vs MUI

The SDS `ButtonDropdown` component is just the regular `Button` component, with the `chevronDown` icon added at the end of the button after the label text, via the MUI `endIcon` prop. Additionally, `ButtonDropdown` requires a `startIcon`.  In SDS, both the `endIcon` and `startIcon` props take the `Icon` component, which references the specific icon to call as one of its props, like so:

		`startIcon={<Icon sdsIcon="download" sdsSize="s" sdsType="button" />}`  

whereas MUI expects the prop to receive an individual icon as its own component (for example`startIcon={<DeleteIcon />}`).

Since `ButtonIcon` is very similar to SDS's `Button` component, similar caveats apply in terms of the MUI props. The following props are available to MUI's `Button` component, but produce no effect (or unexpected effects) for SDS's `ButtonIcon` component, so it is recommended to not use them:

* **`variant`****:**  This prop is intended to set the `Button` to either `text` only, `contained`,  or `outlined`.  With SDS's `ButtonIcon`,  however, they do not function as described in the MUI documentation; however, similar effects, specific to SDS's styles, can be achieved through a combination of the SDS-only `sdsStyle`  and `sdsType` props (see below).
* **`color`****:**  This prop doesn't work as expected for SDS's `ButtonIcon`,  which doesn't support colors or intents. The `sdsType` prop can be used to set the button as `primary` or `secondary`,  though.
* **`size`****:**  This prop is not supported for SDS's `ButtonIcon`
*  **`disableElevation`****:**  The SDS `ButtonIcon` component doesn't have a visual "elevation" or shadowed treatment by default (which this prop disables for MUI's `Button`).  However, setting `disableElevation={false}` will not render the MUI default elevation treatment.

SDS's `ButtonIcon` has additional props to allow flexibility while maintaining the SDS styles:

* **`sdsStyle`****:**  takes `minimal` (default), `rounded`,  or `square` as values
* **`sdsType`****:**  takes `primary` (default, filled) or `secondary` (outlined) as values
