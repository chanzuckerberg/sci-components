# Text Link

Text Links are interactive elements that, when clicked, navigate the user away from the page they are currently viewing to another page or screen.

## Overview

## Text Link Variants

| There are two Text Link variants available for designers to use depending on the background on top of which they are placed and whether that background provides enough contrast for the Default Text Link to be seen. Text links can be used inline or separate from a paragraph of text.  Though visually similar to [Minimal Buttons](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/4289c6-buttons/t/25a37c), Text Links navigate the user away from the page they are currently viewing to another page. This is in contrast to [Minimal Buttons](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/4289c6-buttons/t/25a37c), which keep the user on the same page and facilitate on-screen actions such as opening Dialogs or indicating less-emphasized actions.  Note: Designers, when including an inline Text Link in your design, styles must be manually applied as there is no way to save the Text Link style in Figma as a text style. You may use the Text Link Figma component for links that are not inline.  Follow the usage criteria accompanying each variant as a guide for selecting the correct Text Link for any given use case. |   | **Jump to variant:** [Default](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/055ad9-text-links/t/0372ba) [Dashed](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/055ad9-text-links/t/673903) |

### Default Text Link

Use the Default Text Link when the Text Link is placed on `white`, `gray100`, or `gray200` backgrounds to ensure there is enough contrast to pass visual accessibility standards.

### Dashed Text Link

Use the Dashed Text Link when the Text Link is placed on a background where the Default Text Link does not provide enough contrast to pass visual accessibility standards. The color of the link and its underline is inherited from the color used in the paragraph it is part of, see [Dashed Text Link Color Examples](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/055ad9-text-links/t/864b58) below.

| **Default** | **Hover** | **Pressed** |

### Dashed Text Link Color Examples

See below for visual examples of how the Dashed Text Link should be used in different colors depending on the color of the background it is placed upon.

| **Black Text** | **Gray500 Text** | **White Text** |

### Text Link Spacing

These rules establish how much margin should exist between and around elements.

Note: Default Text Links fall in line with the rest of the text in the paragraph it is part of. Dashed Text Links are spaced lower than a default underline text-decoration.

## Text Link Component

| Below you will find an interactive Storybook iframe for Text Links.  Tabs within each iframe provide a different set of tools: The Controls tab allows you to see and adjust all available props. The Actions tab shows you data displayed by event handler arguments. |   | **Jump to component:** [Link](https://sds.czi.design/009eaf17b/v/0/p/055ad9-text-links/t/254177) |

>This component appears as it is in the default SDS codebase. Once imported into the CZ GEN EPI codebase, use a theme file to enable the CZ GEN EPI visual appearance customization.
