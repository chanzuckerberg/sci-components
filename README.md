# Components

CZIF Science Initiative Component Library

## Get Started

### Installation

https://www.npmjs.com/package/czifui

```shell
npm i czifui
```

or

```shell
yarn add czifui
```

NOTE: Please make sure the peer dependencies are installed as well

### Peer Dependencies

In order to avoid installing multiple versions of the same library in the host project, which could cause bugs, the component library does **NOT** have its own dependencies.

Therefore, please kindly ensure your project includes the following dependencies in your project's `package.json`:

```json
  "@emotion/css"
  "@emotion/react"
  "@emotion/styled"
  "@material-ui/core"
  "@material-ui/icons"
  "@material-ui/lab"
  "react"
  "react-dom"
```

Install the peer dependencies in your project:

```shell
npm i @emotion/css @emotion/react @emotion/styled @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab react react-dom
```

or

```shell
yarn add @emotion/css @emotion/react @emotion/styled @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab react react-dom
```

### Demo

`czifui` comes with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) integration, so you can browse the components locally by following the steps below:

1. Cloning the repo: `git clone git@github.com:chanzuckerberg/sci-components.git`
1. Run: `yarn && yarn start`
1. A new browser tab will be automatically opened with the storybook!

#### Tips

It's super useful to read the `*.stories.tsx` files to see how the components are used in real examples. You can also find additional examples in [Aspen](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/aspen), which uses `czifui` extensively

## Default Theme

### Instructions

To use the default theme, please do the following:

1. Add the following HTML to your `index.html` at the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
   <link
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,400;1,600;1,700&display=swap"
     rel="stylesheet"
   />
   ```

1. Import the default theme object and use it in Material UI's `<ThemeProvider />`:

   ```tsx
     import { defaultTheme } from '@chanzuckerberg/czifui/core/styles`
     import { ThemeProvider } from "@material-ui/core/styles";

     <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
       <YourApp />
     </ThemeProvider>
   ```

1. Optional: If you want to override the default theme, please use `defaultAppTheme`, override the options, and then call `createTheme` to generate
   the full theme object like below. This is needed because `createTheme` generates
   extra theme variables based on the themeOptions provided, so if you override `defaultTheme` directly, some auxillary theme variables will be based on `defaultAppTheme` instead of your own custom options

```tsx
  import { ThemeProvider as EmotionThemeProvider } from "@emotion/react";
  import { defaultAppTheme, makeThemeOptions } from '@chanzuckerberg/czifui/core/styles`
  import { StylesProvider, ThemeProvider } from "@material-ui/core/styles";
  import createTheme from "@material-ui/core/styles/createTheme";

  const customTheme = {
    ...
  }

  const appTheme = makeThemeOptions({ ...defaultAppTheme, ...customTheme })

  const theme = createTheme(appTheme)

    <StylesProvider injectFirst>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <EmotionThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <YourApp />
        </EmotionThemeProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </StylesProvider>
```

## Design System

`czifui` implements the Science Initiative Design System as documented in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EaRifXLFs54XTjO1Mlszkg/Science-Design-System-Reference). As a result, it's very useful to get familiar with the available **theme variables**, such as `colors`, `spacings`, `typography`, etc., so you can leverage the theme properly in your application.

(NOTE: Please use the left panel to find different types of components (Bases, Genes, DNA, and Chromosomes))

## How to Use

`czifui` comes with three main exports that help you build your app following the design system:

1. Components - Components that implement the design system

   E.g., `Alert`, `Button`, `Menu`

   Source: [src/core](src/core)

   NOTE: Since most of the `czifui` components are built on top of Material UI's equivalent, it's also super useful to use their [API documentation](https://material-ui.com/) to learn about what you can do with the components

1. Mixins - Mixins defined by the design system

   E.g., `fontBodyL`, `fontHeaderM`, `fontCapsXxs`

   Source: [src/core/styles/common/mixins](src/core/styles/common/mixins)

1. Selectors - Helper functions that pick out theme variables for you

   E.g., `getSpacings`, `getColors`, `getCorners`, `getFontWeights`

   Source: [src/core/styles/common/selectors](src/core/styles/common/selectors)

### Example

```ts
    import { fontBodyM, getColors, getSpacings } from "czifui";

    export const Foo = styled.div`
      // This is the design system's font body medium mixin we import from czifui
      ${fontBodyM}

      // This is the regular css rules
      overflow: auto;

      // This is a callback function that returns more CSS rules, but the only way
      // to access the custom theme object
      ${(props) => {
        // getColors() is a selector that picks out colors from the theme object
        const colors = getColors(props);
        // getSpacings() is a selector that picks out spacings from the theme object
        const spacings = getSpacings(props);

        return `
          background-color: ${colors?.gray[500]};
          padding-bottom: ${spacings?.m}px;
          margin-bottom: ${spacings?.xxl}px;
        `;
      }}
    `;
```

NOTE: If you are not familiar with `styled()`, please check out Emotion's `styled()` API [here](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled)

NOTE II: You can find more examples in the repo's `*.stories.tsx` and [Aspen](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/aspen)

## Q&A

1. Why wrapping a component with `styled()` doesn't style the root element as expected?

   This is likely because the component is **NOT** forwarding the css class name that `styled()` generates to the intended root element. So we likely need to update the `czif` component to make it work

   For example, if a `czif` component `Foo` has the following implementation, `styled(Foo)` won't style the wrapper `<div />` as expected:

   ```tsx
   function Foo() {
     return (
       <div>
         <ChildA />
         <ChildB />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

   The fix is:

   ```tsx
   function Foo({className}) {
     return (
       <div className={className}>
         <ChildA />
         <ChildB />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

1. To style a sub-component of a `czif` component, typically we export the sub-component for the call site to import and style via `styled`, and then you will be able to pass back the styled sub-component to the `czif` component through prop

   For example, `ComplexFilter` exports `ComplexFilterInputDropdown` sub-component, so if you want to style it, you can do the following:

   ```tsx
   import { ComplexFilter, ComplexFilterInputDropdown } from 'czifui'
   import styled from '@emotion/styled'

   const StyledComplexFilterInputDropdown = styled(ComplexFilterInputDropdown)`
    color: pink;
   `

   function Foo() {
     return <ComplexFilter InputDropdownComponent={StyledComplexFilterInputDropdown} />
   }
   ```
